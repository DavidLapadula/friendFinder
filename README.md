# Bamazon Command Line App

### Summary
***

This is a shopping app which leverages mySQL and node.js with 3 levels. In level one the user acts as a customer by making purchases while the database is updated in the background to account for sales and depleting inventory. In level two the user acts as a manager and has the ability to add items to the inventory and and check various quantities. Level three is for the supervisor, where the user can view the total profits from each department, check the department that is performing the best, and even add departments to the database. General error checking is in place for all user inputs. If the required field is a number, the user must input a number and cannot input a negative integer, and if a word is required than a number is not accpeted. Duplicates are also not accepted when entering new information into the database. Each app also allows the user to constinue making transactions after one is completed using recursion.

##### Level 1: Customer
***

In the customer level, this application allows the customer to use the ID of the items listed to make a purchase. If the id is not in the table, the user is prompted to try again. If the order amount is greater than the stock, the user recieves a message informing them the order can not be met. If the ID is correct and the stock is available, then the order is processed, the database is updated and the order information is displayed to the user.

###### View products for sale

###### View low inventory
***

This allows the manager to view all products with low quantity. Because of the large quantities of my mock files, this displays any item with a quantity less than 50.

###### Add to Inventory
***

This allows the manager to add stock to an already existing product. A list of products is provided to prevent adding stock to a non - existent product. Upon success a message is displayed to the user informing them the addition has been made with the details of the update.

###### Add a new product
***

This allows the manager to add a brand new product. A list of existing departments is provided to prevent the manager from adding a product in a department that is not already in the database (only supervisors can add departments). Furthermore the user cannot add a product that already exists. Once the input passes these tests, the database is updated to reflect the change and the user recieves a message with the details of the new product being added.
