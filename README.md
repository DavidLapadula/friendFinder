# Node Friend Find

## Summary
***

This application uses compatbility testing to match users with friends on the internet. The user answers basic personality questions from a generated survey and then his/her scores are compared to a list of other users to find the closest match. Once a match is found, the user is shown the name and picture of their match on a pop up modal. 

If you would like to test it out, you can find it [here](https://shrouded-plateau-39057.herokuapp.com/)
